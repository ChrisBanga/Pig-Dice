# Pig-Dice
#### <em> By Christophe Banga
## Description
This project is about a game of probabilities involving 2 players.
At each turn, a player repeatedly rolls a die until either a 1 is rolled or the player decides to "hold":

The basic rules are as follows:

* If the player rolls a 1, they score nothing and it becomes the next player's turn.
* If the player rolls any other number, it is added to their turn total and the player's turn continues.
* If a player chooses to "hold", their turn total is added to their score, and it becomes the next player's turn.

**NB:**  The first player to score 100 or more points wins.
##### Example:
Player rolls dice in sequence 2-3-4-5. If he decides to "hold", his tally of points become 14. If he plays his next round and gets a 1, then his tally becomes 0. In either case Player 2, starts his round.
